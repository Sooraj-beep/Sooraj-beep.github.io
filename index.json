I’ll unveil the decisions I made, the challenges I encountered, and the tools I used to solve them.\nJoin me as I shine a light on the behind-the-scenes magic that powers Sherp2.0 and discover how it’s set to evolve and enhance the university experience for countless students.\nDefining the Vision: Sherp2.0’s Core Requirement Sherp2.0 embarked on its journey with a singular mission: to ease the transition of university freshmen by providing quick access to answers to their frequently asked questions.\nPicture this: a bewildered freshman, grappling with the maze of university life, desperately seeking answers. This scenario was our driving force.\nTo excel in this endeavor, Sherp2.0 needed more than just a static repository of information. It required a living, breathing knowledge base—one that constantly evolved to cater to the changing needs of students.\nBut herein lay the challenge: How could we make it effortless for anyone to contribute their wisdom to this knowledge bank while ensuring the utmost accuracy and reliability?\nSolving Our First Roadblock The answer became quite clear to me: GitHub! I established a public repository for the bot and utilized a JSON file to store information.\nStudents could create GitHub Issues to track and discuss potential additions to the bot’s knowledge base. This platform also enabled them to engage in discussions regarding revisions to existing information.\nOnce all was said and done, they could submit a Pull Request, subject to scrutiny by more experienced students.\nEmploying GitHub as a collaborative platform for the bot perfectly aligns with the project’s initial principles. Contributors could enhance the bot’s knowledge base without the need to set up a development environment; all they had to do was contribute to a JSON file.\nThe project maintainers would then review and test the contributions before deploying the changes to production.\nBest of all, this method is incredibly cost-effective; there’s no need to spend a single dime on hosting your projects on GitHub.\nThe first folder structure for Sherp2.0 is shown below:\n- root - bot.py - data - 8ball.json - commands.json - contests.json - copypasta.json - ... Bringing Sherp2.0 to Life: Deployment Using AWS Now that we have a platform for Sherp2.0 to have an ever-evolving and up to date knowledge base. It was time to go live with it so thousands of university students could take advantage of its features.\nRemaining steadfast to our principles of simplicity and cost-effectiveness, I embarked on extensive research to find the perfect deployment solution. After careful consideration, the answer became clear: AWS EC2. AWS’s generous free-tier offering, coupled with its user-friendly setup, made it an ideal choice.\nWhile I acknowledge that this may not be a permanent solution due to expected growth in users and feature additions, for now, it functions seamlessly.\nPiecing the Puzzle Together: GitHub Actions We have our knowledge base hosted on GitHub and the bot deployed on an EC2 instance. But what happens when the knowledge base is updated? How will we get the deployed bot to use the updated knowledge?\nFurthermore, the knowledge base is constantly updated so manually deploying the bot every single time would be tedious.\nWell, let me introduce you to GitHub Actions; a CI/CD service provided by GitHub. It allows developers to build, test, and deploy your code as well as perform other tasks based on specific events or triggers.\nE2E workflow for Sherp2.0 The workflow used to deploy to EC2 instance that gets triggered when a commit happens in master branch:\nname: Deploy code to EC2 instance on: push: branches: [ master ] pull_request: branches: [ master ] jobs: deploy: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Checkout code uses: actions/checkout@v2 - name: Install SSH run: sudo apt-get install -y ssh - name: Copy code to EC2 instance uses: appleboy/scp-action@master with: host: \u0026#34;ec2-3-131-94-181.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com\u0026#34; username: \u0026#39;ubuntu\u0026#39; key: ${{ secrets.PILOT_EC2_KEY }} source: \u0026#39;.\u0026#39; target: \u0026#39;/home/ubuntu/sherp2\u0026#39; - name: Rebuild bot on EC2 instance uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master with: host: \u0026#34;ec2-3-131-94-181.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com\u0026#34; username: \u0026#39;ubuntu\u0026#39; key: ${{ secrets.PILOT_EC2_KEY }} script: | cd /home/ubuntu/sherp2 export NVM_DIR=~/.nvm source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh npm install pm2 pm2 stop sherp2 pip install -r requirements.txt pm2 start sherp2 Conclusion As we conclude this journey through the Sherp2.0 DevOps landscape, let it serve as an inspiration for your own …","date":1693785600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693785600,"objectID":"370c96b3056960db47ae0535e8271c06","permalink":"https://Sooraj-beep.github.io/post/sherp-devops/","publishdate":"2023-09-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/sherp-devops/","section":"post","summary":"An overview of the tools and services used to run Sherp2.0.","tags":null,"title":"The Simple DevOps Infrastructure behind Sherp2.0","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1682899200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1682899200,"objectID":"5c438b85672d99d19ad94e83f73eff01","permalink":"https://Sooraj-beep.github.io/project/sherp2.0/","publishdate":"2023-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/sherp2.0/","section":"project","summary":"A community run discord chatbot that answers CS questions for students at the University of Alberta.","tags":["Discord Bots"],"title":"Sherp2.0","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1681516800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1681516800,"objectID":"4fd548708eaf28559c6ef7f34b17055b","permalink":"https://Sooraj-beep.github.io/project/epicgamesbot/","publishdate":"2023-04-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/epicgamesbot/","section":"project","summary":"This bot makes it easy to see weekly free games provided by epic games through discord announcements.","tags":["Discord Bots"],"title":"EpicGamesFreeGameNotifierBot","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Project overview Vocabulary explorer was a capstone project I built alongside 5 other developers for CMPUT 401 at the University of Alberta. Our clients were ALTLab; a linguistic research group based at the university. We were given access to the Cree words search api, definitions of words, and connections between words based on semantics. Our job was to build a interactive visual map of word domains based on user query over the span of four months.\nDemo Utilized Features Search the Cree database using both english or cree words as query. Hear how Cree words are pronounced. View an interactive map of domains that contain Cree words and hypernym and hyponym domains that connect to it. My Accomplishments Took ownership of Project Requirements Document; Converted client requirements into atomized user stories and modified them based on clients changing needs. Spearheaded the interactive word map feature of the product; converting client data obtained from their API endpoints into graph built using D3. Acted as scrum-master throughout the whole project, ensuring agile prinicples were followed. Reduced graph load times from 10-15 seconds to almost instantaneous by using a design principle known as lazy loading.
